In this repository there are my solutions to the assigned homeworks of the course [Functional Languages] (http://informatica.math.unipd.it/laureamagistrale/functionallanguages.html) at the [University of Padua] (http://www.unipd.it/).

The lecture was held in the first semester of the Academic Year 2016/2017 as part of the "Software" area of the [Master Degree] (http://informatica.math.unipd.it/laureamagistrale/index.html) in Computer Science.
